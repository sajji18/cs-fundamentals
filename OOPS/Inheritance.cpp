/*
Encapsulation:
It says, keep all information related to an entity in 1 class only.
For Example:
    If we have 2 classes, car and sportscar.
    Car has 5 basic properties, and sportscar has 3 add-on properties (But We do not add the basic properties again in this class)
    To represent a sportscar, we have to create 2 objects, one of car and one of sportscar to represent all 8 variables
    Thus this is against the rule of encapsulation and we need INHERITANCE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

Inheritance:
It is a provess of inheriting propertues and behaviours of existing class into a new class
Existing class = Old Class = Parent Class = Base Class
New Class = Child Class = Derived Class
=> Class is used to describe properties and behaviour of an object
=> Property : Names and Values
=> Behaviour : Actions

Syntax of Inheritance: (Visibility Mode is public, private or protected)
    class BASE_CLASS {};
    class DERIVED_CLASS : Visibility_Mode BASE_CLASS {};

Types of Inheritance:
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Multiple Inheritance
4. Hierarchical Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance
